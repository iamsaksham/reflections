How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was all available on command prompt. All the changes were visible there so it was really easy to point out a bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

No more typo and bugs as I can compare history of files and checkout for bugs, so it made me a cool programmer.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Git is flexible, google docs is not. Git commit duration between two commits
can be big but google docs save versions after a fixed time interval

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because files can be related to each other to compile successfully

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log tells the commit id and git diff tells the difference between those
ids, so with the help of both history can be easily tracked.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

We can easily give it a shot as we have a backup and nothing to loose.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
